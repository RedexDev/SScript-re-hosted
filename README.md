# SScript-re-hosted
Librarie for Friday Night Funkin' Engines!

This is a rescued SScript library that belongs to (tahirk786, as far as I know I hope I'm not wrong).
You can use it in your projects but this will not have future updates because this is not mine because it is only an archive because its original repository was deleted and I don't know the reasons for its deletion. But if everything goes well and by chance this repository is not deleted I might also publish other versions of almost lost media.
And if you are wondering why they removed support for this library from the official profile I honestly don't know what was the reason.

Command:

`haxelib git SScript https://github.com/RedexDev/SScript-re-hosted`
